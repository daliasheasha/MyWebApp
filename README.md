# MyWebApp
A simple web application that uses Docker and Docker Compose. Checkout my [Intro to Docker - Part 2 (Networking, Docker Compose)](https://youtu.be/_m9JYAvFB8s) and [Docker in IntelliJ IDEA](https://youtu.be/ck6xQqSOlpw) videos that goes with it!

Instructions to get the application up and running:

0. Make sure docker is installed and running.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the application war (Run `mvn install` or use IntelliJ IDEA to build the war file).
3. Run `docker-compose up`. Give the application a few seconds to come up. 
4. Access the application at http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/
